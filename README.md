# classifier-selection-module
A module with classifier selection methods that can be called with dataset as parameters to return the best classifier for the job over a set of default hyperparameters or custom hyperparams.

v0.1.1: Added support for various other tree based classifiers and expanded the parameter lists we are working with.
v0.1.2: Removed plotting of hyperparameter dicts. Final values are enough and that data can be queried from the class.
